### How do you plan to use GitHub?

This is a generic answer, but you should keep it like 2-3 sentences that revolve around:
* Using it to contribute to the Great Neck Game Design Club
* Writing code and collaborating with others
* Publish code for Games developed

etc...

*It isn't a college essay, but be professional.*

After that, **click <kbd>Continue</kbd>**

### Next form

You might be prompted by your browser to allow GitHub to use your location. **You must allow in order for GitHub to verify the validity of your attendance at GNSHS**

The next page is a page (I sadly do not have any pictures of this form) where you must submit an identification form. **Just take a picture of your SCHOOL ID that is clear and visible on the FRONT where it has your face.**

Then you should be able to press a button related to `Process my application`.

### Waiting for results

There are two possible results.
