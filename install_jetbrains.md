# Install JetBrains Toolbox

JetBrains toolbox is the app that will be used to install the IDE we will use: Rider.

Make sure the orange dropdown says the correct operating system that you have. For me I have Linux, so it is saying `.tar.gz`. Otherwise, if you are on Windows, it should say `.exe`.

## Download the file

This will be your routine installation process for your operating system and I am confident you know how to do this.

# Setting up the program

Once the program launches. You should be met with something looks like this:

(*Note: This is my own install, so just see if the image kinda matches yours*)

## Connecting your account

Click the cog menu titled `Toolbox App Menu` at the top right.

Scroll down until you can find **Rider**:
